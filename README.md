Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed Task 2 of my web development internship at Prodigy InfoTech , where I created a functional stopwatch! ðŸŽ‰
This project was a fantastic opportunity for me to apply my coding skills and gain hands-on experience in web development. I learned a lot about implementing timing functions and enhancing user interaction.
